<Synopsis>
The idea for the SpaceShooterAlpha project came about when me and a couple of my friends reintroduced ourselves to the classic bullet hell shooter Ikaruga on Xbox Live Arcade at one of our game nights. Being a fan of arcade shooters and seeing a rise in the popularity of competitive games such as Street Fighter and Dota, with this project I set out to see how a classic arcade shooter could work as a VS. shooter.
